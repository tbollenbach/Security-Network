## ⚠️ Important Security Considerations

### Before Production Use

1. **Security Audit Required**: This codebase has not undergone professional security auditing
2. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct thorough penetration testing
3. **Dependencies**: Review and update all dependencies regularly
4. **Key Management**: Implement proper secret management (vault, HSM)
5. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
6. **Monitoring**: Set up production-grade monitoring and alerting
7. **Incident Response**: Develop incident response procedures

### Known Limitations

- Some cryptographic implementations are prototypes
- Quantum-resistant algorithms need validation
- Performance benchmarks are estimated/theoretical
- Test coverage is incomplete
- Some features require additional hardening
- Distributed consensus mechanisms need real-world testing

### Do Not Commit

Never commit to version control:
- `.env.security` files
- `config.secure.json` with actual secrets
- Private keys or certificates
- API keys or tokens

---

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

**For Development**:
- Use separate secrets for dev/staging/production
- Never use production credentials locally
- Test security features in isolated environments
- Review security logs regularly

**For Deployment**:
- Use environment-specific configuration
- Implement certificate pinning
- Enable all security features
- Configure rate limiting appropriately
- Set up geofencing if applicable
- Monitor security dashboards
- Rotate secrets regularly (every 90 days recommended)
