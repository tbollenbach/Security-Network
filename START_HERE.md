**Tech Stack** (MVP):
- Backend: Fastify + TypeScript + PostgreSQL
- Agent: Node.js daemon
- Dashboard: React + Vite
- Auth: OIDC (Auth0/Keycloak) + JWT RS256

**Scope**: Follow MVP_PLAN.md strictly. No feature creep!

---

### 🎯 "I want to see what's possible"

**Capabilities with 100 Nodes**:
1. [docs/NETWORK_CAPABILITIES.md](docs/NETWORK_CAPABILITIES.md) - Detailed examples

**Real Use Cases**:
- Video rendering: 100x faster
- AI training: 10x faster
- Big data: 112x faster
- Cost savings: $406K/year vs cloud

---

### 🎓 "I'm learning about distributed systems"

**Start Here**:
1. [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) - System design
2. [docs/TRUST_MESH.md](docs/TRUST_MESH.md) - Distributed consensus
3. [docs/API.md](docs/API.md) - API reference

**Concepts Covered**:
- Distributed resource pooling
- Zero-trust architecture
- Consensus protocols
- Security in distributed systems

## 🚦 IMPLEMENTATION PATH

### Path 1: Quick Demo (1 week)
```
1. Set up backend_server (basic config)
2. Run 5 agent instances locally
3. Open dashboard
4. See resources pooling
```

### Path 2: Secure MVP (30 days)
```
1. Follow MVP_PLAN.md week by week
2. Implement all SECURITY_BASELINE.md controls
3. Test with 10+ real devices
4. Deploy to production
```

### Path 3: Enterprise Deployment (180 days)
```
1. Complete Phase 1 (MVP)
2. Add Phase 2 (enhanced security)
3. Add Phase 3 (advanced features)
4. Prepare Phase 4 (enterprise certification)
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT WARNINGS

### Before Deploying to Production:

1. ✅ Generate proper TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt)
2. ✅ Generate JWT keys (RS256, 2048-bit minimum)
3. ✅ Review PRIVACY_POLICY.md (add your org details)
4. ✅ Review TERMS_OF_USE.md (add your jurisdiction)
5. ✅ Set up monitoring & alerts
6. ✅ Run security audit (`npm audit`)
7. ✅ Test backup/restore procedure
8. ✅ Configure rate limiting
9. ✅ Enable audit logging
10. ✅ Review all .env variables

### Before Enabling Biometric Features:

1. ⚠️ Get legal review (GDPR, CCPA, BIPA)
2. ⚠️ Create consent forms
3. ⚠️ Implement deletion API
4. ⚠️ Test liveness detection accuracy
5. ⚠️ Don't promise 95%+ unless tested on real datasets

## 🎯 QUICK DECISIONS

**Q**: Which README should I use?  
**A**: `README_PROFESSIONAL.md` for production. `README.md` is marketing version.

**Q**: Which JWT implementation?  
**A**: `auth-correct.js` - Uses proper RS256

**Q**: What security level for MVP?  
**A**: Follow `SECURITY_BASELINE.md` - No custom crypto!

**Q**: Should I implement biometrics now?  
**A**: NO. Phase 3 only, with legal review.

**Q**: What about blockchain?  
**A**: Merkle tree is fine. Full blockchain in Phase 3.

**Q**: Performance targets?  
**A**: 1,000 req/s for MVP. Scale later.
